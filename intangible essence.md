[intangible essence]

standing by the glistening lake 
reflecting the delicate rays of the moon,
amidst the ripples, your silhouette lurks despite your absence,

i reach out, to feel the warmth of your hand,
only for the mirror to shatter,
upon glance, i step back,
only for the image to return,

alas admiring you from afar was my fate all along.
