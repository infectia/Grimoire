looking at the same stars you did,
in the land of the language beknownst to me,
the silent river of memories vehemently sloshed around my hands you once held,
i let myself drift along for, drowning mattered not.

walking on the same sand you had blessed,
in the land of the language beknownst to me.
alas the seashells you promised to pick for me, were being picked by me.

every moment of silence, is filled by you. 
i dare not forget you.

i look around, trying to find your semblance, in the clouds,
in the shadows, in the waves, in the sands,
in my heart.

anything remotely close to you,
washed away by the waves, left me with nothing
but memories i can't escape.

in the land of the language beknownst to me, i reminisce.
