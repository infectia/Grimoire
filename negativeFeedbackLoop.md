[negative feedback loop ft. a hopeless romantic]

you showed up, holding up flowers, and 
a smile you thought looked benign; 
all i saw, however, was a smile feigned.

a masquerade in the evening, 
unveiling an entourage of masked folk; 
several fonts of you, for every mask of yours.
they're all still you, the one i truly love.

though it hurts me that you're masked, 
i'll always be there with a smile, 
waiting for you.
like the everglistening stars, my eyes light up, 
everytime i see you, any font of you, just you.

is it wishful of me to hope that, 
someday you'll take your mask off, 
and pursue your happiness, 
in lieu of mine?

as long as you're happy, i mindÂ not.
